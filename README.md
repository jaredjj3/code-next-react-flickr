# code-next-react-flickr

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/code-next-react-flickr)

A lesson for the [Code Next](https://codenext.withgoogle.com/) React club.

In this lesson, engineers will replicate SnapShot ([repo](https://github.com/Yog9/SnapShot), [demo](https://yog9.github.io/SnapShot/#/SnapScout)) using the [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/) for their final projects

## API Key

Many APIs provide an API key, which is the mechanism by which requests are made to an API on your behalf. Usage of API keys are usually tracked. That way, if a particular API key holder spams the API, that API key can be disabled without affecting other API key holders.

### **⚠️⚠️⚠️Please do not commit your API key nor secret to your repository⚠️⚠️⚠️**

This prevents other users from using your key and making you responsible for requests made with that key.

In a production-ready application, you could have your server make the requests on the users' behalf on the server side to prevent the users from ever having access to it. However, this has cost implications as the server is making the requests. Ultimately, you should check with the vendor's documentation to understand how the API key is meant to be used.
